# After finishing part 1 of the series house classification, classified from posts' contents by using BagOfWord
# Here is the link of my part 1: https://github.com/ToDuyHung/house_classification_using_bow
# This is part 2, where I will classify houses from posts' contact phone by using hash
# The criterias to classify and link drive to get 2 files 'data_1.json' and 'result2.json' are described clearly in file "Mô tả công việc.docx"
# Make sure you read "Mô tả công việc.docx" first !
# Now, let's do house_classification_by_contact_phone:
# Step 1: Create new python project
# Step 2: Paste file data_1.json and classification_by_contact_phone.py into venv folder
# Step 3: Run the python file to see your result
# Note: Don't paste my file result2.json into venv folder. It's just used for reference.
