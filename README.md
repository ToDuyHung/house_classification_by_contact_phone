# house_classification_by_contact_phone
After part 1 of House Classification from the posts's content using Bag Of Word
This is my next part 2, this time we will classificate from the posts's contact phone
How to build it:
Step 1: Create new python project
Step 2: Paste file test_data_with_contact_phone.json and classification_by_contact_phone.py into venv folder.
Step 3: Don't paste my file result2.json. Create your new one with the same name to see the result.
Thank you for reading <3
